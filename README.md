## 📍 The Process

The Lantern Store project is a real-world e-commerce solution built to support a small lantern business. I wanted to deliver a simple yet effective shopping experience for users, especially those using mobile devices. 

I chose **Next.js** for its excellent performance, built-in routing, and server-side rendering which improves both speed and SEO — important for product visibility. Tailwind CSS made it fast and easy to design a clean, responsive UI. The frontend interacts seamlessly with the backend API to provide real-time product listings, order placement, and tracking.

This app demonstrates my ability to create a complete frontend for real-world use, with future scalability in mind.
